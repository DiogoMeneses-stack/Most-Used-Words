1
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,756
She didn't know. How should I know?

2
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,261
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

3
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,890
Did I say that out loud?

4
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,896
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

5
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,481
You're angry. You're hurting.

6
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,942
Can I tell you what the answer is?

7
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,444
Strip joints!

8
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,948
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

9
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,451
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

10
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,829
I just wanna be married again.

11
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,086
And I just want a million dollars!

12
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,297
Rachel?

13
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,175
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

14
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,511
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

15
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,889
...that you might be here, and you are.

16
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,643
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

17
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,189
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

18
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,900
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

19
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,361
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

20
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,654
- Sure!
- Hey.

21
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,739
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

22
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,125
So you wanna tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

23
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,341
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

24
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,927
I was in this room
with all the presents...

25
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,929
...and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

26
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,557
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

27
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,559
When all of a sudden...
Sweet 'N Low?

28
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,853
- I realized...

29
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,941
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

30
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,152
Then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

31
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,114
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

32
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,784
You know, I mean, I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

33
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,290
Anyway, I just had to get out of there,
and I started wondering:

34
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,127
"Why am I doing this?"
And "Who am I doing this for?"

35
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,673
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,
and I know you and I have drifted apart...

36
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,718
...but you're the only person
I know in the city.

37
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,594
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

38
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,889
Oh, I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

39
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,573
I'm guessing he bought her
the big pipe organ...

40
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,200
...and she's really not
happy about it.

41
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,496
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.

42
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,332
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,376
I just don't love him.

44
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,504
Well, it matters to me.

45
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,384
She should not be wearing those pants.

46
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,554
I say push her down the stairs.

47
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,974
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

48
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,230
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

49
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,985
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

50
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,237
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

51
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,616
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

52
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,994
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

53
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,954
Or a hat?"

54
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,416
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

55
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,794
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

56
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,381
You can see where he'd have trouble.

57
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,511
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

58
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,306
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

59
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,812
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

60
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,691
Well, maybe that's my decision.

61
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,528
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

62
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,947
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

63
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,123
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

64
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,792
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

65
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,879
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

66
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,217
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

67
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,346
La la la something
With string

68
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,390
I'm all better now.

69
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,185
I helped.

70
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,189
Look, this is probably
for the best, you know?

71
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,067
Independence. Taking control of your life.

72
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,613
And, hey, if you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

73
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,200
Me and Chandler live right
across the hall. And he's away a lot.

74
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,621
Joey, stop hitting on her.
It's her wedding day.

75
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,790
What? Like there's a rule or something?

76
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,880
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

77
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,466
- Uh, it's Paul.
- Buzz him in.

78
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,051
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

79
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,303
Maybe.

80
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,806
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

81
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,808
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes.

82
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,768
Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.

83
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,813
Rach, wait, I can cancel.

84
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,857
Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

85
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,736
Ross, are you okay?
I mean, do you want me to stay?

86
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,739
That'd be good.

87
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,868
- Really?
- No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

88
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,124
Hi, come in. Paul, this is...

89
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,544
...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

90
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,046
Paul, the wine guy.

91
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:30,091
- Wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

92
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,053
- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.
- Okay.

93
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,310
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

94
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,731
So, Rachel,
what are you up to tonight?

95
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,110
Well, I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

96
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,320
...so, nothing.

97
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,950
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

98
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,204
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh.
This time of year? Eh.

99
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,957
Talk about your...

100
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,166
...big lizards.

101
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,674
Anyway, if you don't feel
like being alone tonight...

102
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,718
...Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

103
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,055
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

104
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,559
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna
hang out here tonight.

105
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,769
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

106
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,271
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

107
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,648
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

108
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:39,286
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

109
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,247
...using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

110
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:48,169
I have no bracket-y thing,
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

111
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,423
...and I cannot feel my legs.

112
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,050
What's this?

113
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,262
I have no idea.

114
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,558
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

115
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,938
This was Carol's favorite beer.

116
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,693
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

117
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,071
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.

118
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,451
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

119
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,660
What did you get?

120
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,037
You guys.

121
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,289
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- You got screwed.

122
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,793
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

123
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,882
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

124
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,259
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

125
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,845
My brother's going through that.
He's such a mess.

126
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,680
How did you get through it?

127
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,392
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

128
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,144
- Say her...
- Leg?

129
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,229
Heh. That's one way of going through it,
yeah.

130
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,315
Me, I went for the watch.

131
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,651
- You actually broke her watch?
- Mm.

132
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,363
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

133
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:01,534
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

134
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,537
It isn't, it's about me. And I...

135
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,631
Hi. Machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

136
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,512
You know what's scary? What if
there's only one woman for everybody?

137
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:24,057
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

138
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:29,104
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

139
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,816
What are you talking about?
One woman.

140
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,028
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

141
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,949
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

142
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,578
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

143
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,709
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

144
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,628
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

145
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,673
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

146
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,637
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

147
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,348
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

148
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,183
Then stay out of my freezer.

149
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,357
Ever since she walked out on me, I...

150
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,651
What? What?

151
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,653
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

152
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,449
No, it's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

153
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,286
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?

154
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,497
Isn't there?

155
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,875
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

156
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,420
What were you gonna say?

157
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,174
Well... Er, uh...

158
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,552
Ever since she left me, um...

159
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,973
...I haven't been able to perform...

160
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,433
...sexually.

161
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,812
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...

162
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,230
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

163
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,859
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

164
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,736
Um...

165
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,196
How long?

166
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,822
Two years.

167
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,283
Wow!

168
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,411
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

169
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,792
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

170
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,338
Yeah.

171
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,340
Yeah, I do.

172
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,886
I, Joanie, take you, Charles,
as my lawful husband.

173
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,473
- Do you take Joanie...?
- Oh! See.

174
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,853
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

175
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,773
"Grab a spoon."

176
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,609
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

177
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,946
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

178
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,702
You know, here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough...

179
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,413
...to ask a woman out...

180
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,291
...who am I gonna ask?

181
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,981
Isn't this amazing?

182
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,483
I mean, I have never made coffee
before in my life.

183
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,152
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

184
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:28,074
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you
gotta make a Western omelet or something...

185
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,455
Although, actually I'm really
not that hungry this morning.

186
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,708
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

187
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,501
- Morning.
- Morning.

188
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,588
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

189
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,966
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

190
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,848
I had a really great time last night.

191
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,892
Thank you. Thank you so much.

192
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,478
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,985
Thank you.

194
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,619
That wasn't a real date.

195
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,164
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

196
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,501
- Shut up and put my table back.
- Okay.

197
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,545
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

198
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:28,259
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

199
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,431
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

200
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,892
Yeah, we all have jobs.

201
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,728
See, that's how we buy stuff.

202
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,648
Yeah, I'm an actor.

203
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,067
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?

204
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,611
Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

205
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,406
Unless you happened to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

206
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,201
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

207
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,747
I will not take this abuse.

208
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,916
You're right. I'm sorry.

209
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,044
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

210
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,467
So how are you doing today?
Did you sleep okay?

211
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,012
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

212
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,684
I can see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

213
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,401
I know. He's just so...

214
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,111
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

215
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,323
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, it's like that. With feelings.

216
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,867
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!

217
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:39,330
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up,
go to work...

218
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,208
...and not think about him all day.

219
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,336
Or else I'm just gonna
get up and go to work.

220
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,130
- Oh, wish me luck!
- What for?

221
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,633
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

222
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,227
- Hey, Monica.
- Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

223
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,895
How was Florida?

224
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,397
You had sex, didn't you?

225
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,316
How do you do that?

226
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,238
- So, who?
- You know Paul?

227
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,365
Paul, the wine guy?

228
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,117
Oh, yeah, I know Paul.

229
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,164
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

230
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,666
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

231
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,962
Before me, there was no snap
in his turtle for two years.

232
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,760
Of course it was a line.

233
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,846
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

234
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,308
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than:

235
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,393
"To get you into bed."

236
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,021
Is it me?

237
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,733
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

238
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,527
...and men with severe emotional
problems can hear?

239
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,654
All right, come here. Give me your feet.

240
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,997
I just thought he was nice, you know?

241
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,336
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

242
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,258
Guess what.

243
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,219
- You got a job?
- Are you kidding?

244
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,054
I'm trained for nothing.

245
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,933
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.

246
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,643
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

247
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,355
Well, you would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale...

248
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,273
...50 percent off.

249
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,275
Oh, how well you know me.

250
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,363
They're my new "I don't need
a job or my parents.

251
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,782
I've got great boots" boots.

252
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,369
- How'd you pay for them?
- Uh, credit card.

253
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,579
And who pays for that?

254
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,332
Um, my father.

255
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,087
You can't live off your parents
your whole life.

256
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,966
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

257
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,344
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

258
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,012
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

259
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,890
I remember when I first came
to this city, I was 14.

260
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,935
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was back in prison.

261
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,146
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

262
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,691
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields...

263
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,653
...outside Port Authority.
And then he killed himself.

264
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,241
And then I found aromatherapy.
So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

265
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,123
The word you're looking for is:

266
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,958
"Anyway..."

267
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,255
All right. You ready?

268
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,132
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.

269
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,884
Cut. Cut.

270
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,053
Cut, cut, cut.

271
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,600
- Hey.
- All right.

272
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,560
Welcome to the real world.

273
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,521
It sucks. You're gonna love it.

274
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,781
Well, that's it.
You gonna crash on the couch?

275
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,327
- No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

276
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,995
Yeah.

277
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,915
Look what I just found on the floor.

278
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,460
What?

279
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,420
That's Paul's watch.

280
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,672
You can just put it back
where you found it.

281
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,761
Oh, boy. All right.
Good night, everybody.

282
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,970
Good night.

283
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,147
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

284
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,524
- Oh, sorry.
- No. Oh, no. Go.

285
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,652
- No, have it, really.
- Split it?

286
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

287
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,782
Thanks.

288
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,078
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had...

289
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,080
...a major crush on you.

290
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,707
I knew.

291
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,335
You did? Oh.

292
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,130
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

293
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,883
- I did.
- Oh.

294
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,348
Listen, do you think...

295
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,018
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

296
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,983
Do you think it would be okay if
I ask you out sometime, maybe?

297
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,069
Yeah.

298
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,821
Maybe.

299
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,657
Okay.

300
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,872
Okay, maybe I will.

301
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,962
- Good night.
- Good night.

302
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,227
See you.

303
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,770
Mm-hm.

304
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,356
Wait, wait. Hey, what's with you?

305
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,320
I just grabbed a spoon.

306
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,954
Can't believe what I'm hearing.

307
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,873
I can't believe
What I'm hearing here

308
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,250
- What? I said you had...
- What? I said you had...

309
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,754
- Would you stop?
- Oh, was I doing it again?

310
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,797
Yes.

311
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,842
Would anybody like more coffee?

312
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,180
Did you make it or are you just serving it?

313
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,641
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

314
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,352
Kids, new dream.

315
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,439
I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli.
